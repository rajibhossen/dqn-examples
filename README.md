Working examples of Deep Q Network of Reinforcement Learning. In this repository, i collected some tutorial of Deep Q Learning and I wanted to keep them in one place. This is solely for my own reference. I put appropriate credit in the corresponding python file. 

-[mountain-car-dqn.py]: Deep Q network example in mountain car environment. All the states, actions, reward and code structure are described in this [tutorial](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/reinforcement-learning-tensorflow/)
