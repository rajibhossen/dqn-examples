# Deep Q Network Examples
Working examples of Deep Q Network of Reinforcement Learning.The purpose of this repository is to collect some easy-to-follow tutorials of DQN. These tutorials are well explained and good for newcomers in RL like me.  I put appropriate credit in the corresponding python file. 

-[mountain-car-dqn.py](mountain-car-dqn.py): Deep Q network example of mountain car environment. All the states, actions, reward and code structure are described in this [tutorial](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/reinforcement-learning-tensorflow/)

-[taxi-v3-dqn.py](taxi-v3-dqn.py): Deep Q network for Taxi-v3 environment. You can find about this environment [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/). This code described in this nice [tutorial](https://rubikscode.net/2019/07/08/deep-q-learning-with-python-and-tensorflow-2-0/)

-[blob-image-dqn.py](blob-image-dqn.py): Example of blob image and deep q learning. inputs are images. All the states, actions, rewards are explained in this [tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/deep-q-learning-dqn-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/)

-[snake game](https://github.com/maurock/snake-ga): Snake Game with DQN is explained in this repository. You can find the corresponding tutorial in this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-teach-an-ai-to-play-games-deep-reinforcement-learning-28f9b920440a)

#### This repo will be updated continuously.
